## Art Mediums I have Used 

I have used a wide variety of art mediums such as pastel, inking, painting, and digital art!! I intially started my art journey through freehand drawing of chaarcters and gradually expanded into other mediums and styles of drawing such as cross hatching.

Below is some of my art work:

## My Favourite Art Medium

My favourite art medium right now would be cross-hatching using inking because it allows me to be very precise with shading and fine details. It also one of the most enjoyable mediums for me to work in.

## Mediums I Want To Try

I want to try oil and hot wax painting in the future because they are hard mediums to use. As a result, finishing an art piece in those mediums would make me very happy especially if they turn out good.
